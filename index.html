		<h1>Strength heroes</h1>,<br>
		<h1>Strength heroes tend to have more health and health regeneration than heroes of other classes,<br>
			making them more resilient to both physical attacks and spells.<br>
			Strength heroes have the greatest variety in their roles, including that of carry, ganker, and support,<br>
			but almost all of them have some form of strong initiation and are supposed to act as tanks to some degree.<br>
			In addition, heroes with a large amount of strength may greatly increase the damage needed to bring a team down.<br>
			With the exception of Huskar, Io, Phoenix and Dragon Knight in his Elder Dragon Form, all strength heroes are melee.<br>
			Strength heroes are often able to strike a balance between the two and remain relevant at all points of the game.,<br>
			At the moment, there are 37 Strength Heroes implemented in Dota 2.,<br>

			<h2>Wraith King</h2>
			<h1>Ostarion, the Wraith King, is a melee strength hero, as well as a carry and tank,<br>
			capable of both dealing and taking plenty of damage. <br>
			His infamous Reincarnation allows the Wraith King to rise again after death, acting like an Aegis of the Immortal,<br>
			making him especially difficult to kill.<br>
			But if left alive, the Wraith King can wreak havoc upon his enemies, <br>
			his Wraithfire Blast provides reliable damage and a stun on a short cooldown, <br>
			Vampiric Aura grants his team sizeable lifesteal, and Mortal Strike helps make short work of foes.<br></h1>
